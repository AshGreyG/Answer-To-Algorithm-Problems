# ♟️ Answers to Algorithm Problems

This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic problems from various
online judge (OJ) platforms, organized by problem source and difficulty.

## 🚀 Overview

+ 📌 **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, C++
+ 🧠 **Content:** Problem solutions with clear implementation for algorithm
  practice and reference
+ 📂 **Organization:** Grouped by OJ platform (e.g., Luogu) with filenames
  indicating problem IDs and topics
+ 📈 **Purpose:** Track personal progress, share reusable algorithmic problem
  solutions.

## 📂 Structure

```
📦
├── luogu/                  # Solutions from Luogu OJ
├── _writeup/               # Problem write-ups / explanations (if available)
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE                 # MIT License
└── README.md
```

Inside each platform folder, files are named with problem IDs and include
comments for problem tags and approach (like DP, greedy, simulation) when
applicable.

## 🛠 Usage

Clone the repo:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/AshGreyG/Answer-To-Algorithm-Problems.git
```

Explore solutions by platform and problem ID. Use these as references when
practicing algorithm problems or studying different techniques.
